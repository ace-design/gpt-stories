## Installation

First, install the dependencies using `pipenv`:

```
mosser@azrael gpt-stories % pipenv install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, start a pipenv shell

```
mosser@azrael gpt-stories % pipenv shell
Launching subshell in virtual environment...
 . /Users/mosser/.local/share/virtualenvs/gpt-stories-iHWjazbU-python/bin/activate
mosser@azrael gpt-stories %  . /Users/mosser/.local/share/virtualenvs/gpt-stories-iHWjazbU-python/bin/activate
(gpt-stories) mosser@azrael gpt-stories % 
```

## Usage

The code assumes your OpenAI API key is located in a file name `openapi_key.txt` at the root of this repository, and that you are currently in a pipenv shell environment.

By default, the code points to the files located in `dataset/small` (2 backlogs, 2 stories/backlog), to save token usage. 

```
(gpt-stories) mosser@azrael gpt-stories % python extractor.py 
START: 14:05:52
# Processing sample_2.txt
- Story #[1] -- started at 14:05:52
    - #G25# As a repository manager, I want to know all the collections and objects in the DAMS for which I have custodial responsibility. 

        - calling model 14:05:52
        - calling model 14:05:56
        - calling model 14:06:00
    - saving result into: ./output/gpt-3.5-turbo-0613/sample_2.txt_1.json
...
END: 14:06:40
```

Simply edit the `DATASET` global variable to point to the directory of your choice. The script will process each file in the directory as a backlog, with one user story per line.

If you need to start your analysis at a given location (_e.g._, after a server-side error), edit the `START_AT` variable.

As of OpenAI pricing model (July 2023), processing the whole backlog costs lest than $5 (USD).
